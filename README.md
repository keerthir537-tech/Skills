- **Advanced Excel**
  Proficient in using Excel for end-to-end data analysis workflows with Pivot Tables, VLOOKUP/XLOOKUP, INDEX-MATCH, conditional formatting and advanced charting. Skilled in building interactive dashboards using slicers, dynamic formulas, and trend analysis to extract actionable insights from large datasets.
  
**Problem-Solving and Business Analysis**
Strong analytical mindset for solving real-world business problems through quantitative reasoning and logical structuring. Applied problem-solving to various cases involving guestmate analytics, percentile rankings, and scenario modeling ensuring data-driven decision-making. Focused on understanding patterns and opportunities within business cases to optimize outcomes and operational performance. 

**Data Visualization with Power BI**
Experienced in developing interactive dashboards that transform complex data into clear and actionable insights. Skilled in data modeling, ETL (Extract-Transform-Load) processing, and DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to build calculated measures and KPIs. Projects include connecting multiple data sources, designing visual reports on sales, customer engagement and revenue trends and applying best visualization practices for storytelling with data.

**SQL for Data Analysis**
Proficient in writing structured, efficient SQL queries for data extraction, cleaning and manipulation. Familiar with Joins, CTEs, window functions (RANK, DENSE_RANK, ROW_NUMBER) and conditional logic (CASE, IS NULL) to perform in-depth analytical queries. Worked with real-world datasets to generate integrated reports and business KPIs, combining multiple relational tables and identifying key insights critical for data-driven strategies.

**Python Fundamentals**
Possess foundational understanding of Python programming, focused on automating data cleaning, performing statistical computations, and integrating analytical models with visualization libraries. Familiar with pandas, NumPy and matplotlib applying them for exploratory data analysis (EDA), numerical summaries and lightweight data transformations to support decision intelligence.

**Data Validation and Quality Assurance**  Focuses on ensuring accuracy, consistency, and reliability in datasets. Includes skills such as data profiling, cleansing, and rule-based validation to detect missing, duplicate, or inconsistent entries. Data profiling using SQL to identify anomalies, patterns, and schema deviations. Applying data cleansing techniques like deduplication, normalization, and standardization to maintain integrity. Monitoring data quality metrics such as completeness, accuracy, and timeliness.

**Database Design and Optimization** Involves structuring databases efficiently for performance, scalability, and data integrity using advanced SQL and schema design principles.​ Designing normalized relational models and implementing entity relationships to reduce redundancy. Using indexing, partitioning, and query optimization techniques to enhance read/write performance. Conducting database performance tuning by analyzing execution plans and resolving bottlenecks.

**Report Automation and KPI Tracking** Centers on building automated reporting pipelines and dashboards that deliver real-time business insights. It uses BI tools and scripts for consistent performance measurement.​ Creating dynamic, refreshable KPI dashboards in Power BI that auto-update from SQL or API data sources. Defining KPI hierarchies aligned with business objectives (e.g., sales conversion rate, revenue per customer). Leveraging machine learning–enabled analytics to refine KPI projections and detect deviations quickly.

**Statistical Analysis (Variance, Standard Deviation, Correlation)**
Computing variance and standard deviation to measure data dispersion and stability. Using correlation and regression analysis to evaluate dependencies among variables. Applying hypothesis testing and time-series methods for predictive modeling. Performing data summarization and probability distribution analysis in Python or Excel. Visualizing statistical insights using Power BI.
